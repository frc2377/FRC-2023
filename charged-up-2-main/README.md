In the 2022-2023 season Team 2377 started with the 
   # SwerveBot-2022
    ## Team 3512's swerve drive code for the 2022 offseason which was 
   ### Modified from Team 364's [BaseFalconSwerve](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve) project to utilize __NEO motors__

   Therefore, their [instructions](https://github.com/Team364/BaseFalconSwerve#setting-constants) on modifiying the constants to fit your robot will also work on this repo as well.

    ### Configurations
    - Works with a swerve drive with __NEO brushless motors__, __Spark Max motor controllers__, __CTRE CANCoders__, and __CTRE Pigeon 2.0 IMU__.
    - Drive and steer ratios are configured for the __SDS MK4 L2 modules__, but can be easily be adapted to other modules. Remember to invert your turn motor on MK4Is.

Post season we added pre-place commands to add efficiency in our cycle time, leading to a finalist award in post season competition: Baltimore of Baltimore 2023
